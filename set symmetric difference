1. Reading number of English subscribers
python
Copy
Edit
english_count = int(input())
input() reads a line of input as a string.

int() converts that string into an integer.

This tells us how many students have English subscriptions, but the number itself isnâ€™t used beyond reading the input correctly.

2. Reading English subscriber roll numbers
python
Copy
Edit
english_subs = set(map(int, input().split()))
input().split() splits the string into a list of strings.

"1 2 3" â†’ ["1", "2", "3"]

map(int, ...) turns these into integers.

["1", "2", "3"] â†’ [1, 2, 3]

set(...) stores them as a set (removes duplicates and allows set operations).

[1, 2, 3] â†’ {1, 2, 3}

3. Reading number of French subscribers
python
Copy
Edit
french_count = int(input())
Similar to step 1, for input structure purposes.

4. Reading French subscriber roll numbers
python
Copy
Edit
french_subs = set(map(int, input().split()))
Same process as step 2, now for French subscriptions.

5. Finding students subscribed to one newspaper only
python
Copy
Edit
either_but_not_both = english_subs.symmetric_difference(french_subs)
.symmetric_difference() is a built-in set method.

It returns a new set with elements in either one of the sets, but not both.

If a student is in both sets, theyâ€™re excluded from the result.

Alternatively, you could write:

python
Copy
Edit
either_but_not_both = english_subs ^ french_subs
Example:

python
Copy
Edit
english = {1, 2, 3, 4}
french = {2, 3, 5, 6}
english.symmetric_difference(french)  # Output: {1, 4, 5, 6}
6. Getting the total count
python
Copy
Edit
print(len(either_but_not_both))
len() gives the number of elements in the resulting set.

print() displays the answer.
