```python
def minion_game(string):

yaml
Copy
Edit
- This defines a function named `minion_game` that takes one parameter `string`.
- Functions are reusable blocks of code.
- The `string` is the input word that the game will be played on.

---

### ```python
    vowels = 'AEIOU'
A string containing all uppercase vowels.

We'll use this to check whether a character is a vowel using in keyword.

This helps decide which player gets points.

```python
ini
Copy
Edit
stuart_score = 0
kevin_score = 0
yaml
Copy
Edit
- Initialize both players' scores to zero.
- `stuart_score` is for consonant-starting substrings.
- `kevin_score` is for vowel-starting substrings.

---

### ```python
    length = len(string)
Calculates the length of the input string.

Storing it avoids recomputing it in every iteration of the loop.

```python
r
Copy
Edit
for i in range(length):
yaml
Copy
Edit
- A `for` loop that goes through each index `i` in the string.
- `range(length)` means from `0` to `length - 1`.

---

### ```python
        if string[i] in vowels:
Checks if the current character at position i is a vowel.

Uses the in keyword for membership checking.

```python
markdown
Copy
Edit
        kevin_score += length - i
yaml
Copy
Edit
- If it's a vowel, Kevin gets `length - i` points.
- This is because `length - i` substrings can start at position `i`.

---

### ```python
        else:
            stuart_score += length - i
If it's not a vowel, it's a consonant.

Stuart gets the same number of points (length - i) for substrings starting here.

```python
yaml
Copy
Edit
if stuart_score > kevin_score:
yaml
Copy
Edit
- Compares the two scores.
- If Stuart has more points, he wins.

---

### ```python
        print("Stuart", stuart_score)
Prints Stuart’s name and his score.

```python
bash
Copy
Edit
elif kevin_score > stuart_score:
yaml
Copy
Edit
- If Kevin has more points, this block runs.

---

### ```python
        print("Kevin", kevin_score)
Prints Kevin’s name and score.

```python
bash
Copy
Edit
else:
    print("Draw")
yaml
Copy
Edit
- If both scores are equal, prints `"Draw"`.

---

### ```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
This line ensures the following code runs only if the script is executed directly.

Common practice for Python scripts.

```python
ini
Copy
Edit
s = input()
yaml
Copy
Edit
- Takes input from the user and stores it in variable `s`.
- `input()` always returns a string.

---

### ```python
    minion_game(s)
Calls the minion_game function with the input string s.
