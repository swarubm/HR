  #explain
  ‚úÖ def solve(s):
Python Concept: Function definition.

Explanation: Declares a function solve that takes a string s as input and returns a modified version of it.

‚úÖ return ' '.join(word.capitalize() for word in s.split(' '))
Python Concepts:

String method: split(' ') splits the string by spaces into a list of words.

Generator expression: (word.capitalize() for word in ...) creates each word with the first letter capitalized.

String method: capitalize() capitalizes only the first character of the word, rest becomes lowercase.

String method: ' '.join(...) joins the capitalized words back together with single spaces.

Explanation:

Example: 'hello world' ‚Üí 'Hello World'.

Handles multiple spaces properly because it uses ' '.split(' ') to preserve spacing.

‚úÖ if __name__ == '__main__':
Python Concept: Main guard.

Explanation: Ensures the following code runs only when the file is executed directly (not when imported).

‚úÖ fptr = open(os.environ['OUTPUT_PATH'], 'w')
Python Concepts:

File I/O: open() opens a file.

Environment variable: os.environ[...] accesses environment variables.

Mode 'w': Opens the file for writing.

Explanation:

Retrieves a path from the system‚Äôs environment variable OUTPUT_PATH.

Opens a file at that path in write mode to store output.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: os module is used but not imported in this code snippet. You should add:

python
Copy
Edit
import os
before this line.

‚úÖ s = input()
Python Concept: Input from user.

Explanation: Reads a string from standard input.

‚úÖ result = solve(s)
Python Concepts:

Function call.

Explanation: Calls the solve function with input string s, stores the result in result.

‚úÖ fptr.write(result + '\n')
Python Concept: Writing to a file.

Explanation: Writes the modified string followed by a newline into the opened file.

‚úÖ fptr.close()
Python Concept: File handling.

Explanation: Closes the file to safely finish writing.

üìå Example:
If input is:

nginx
Copy
Edit
hello   world
Output written to file will be:

nginx
Copy
Edit
Hello   World
