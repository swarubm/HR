🔍 Step-by-Step Explanation
🔸 int(input())
Reads user input as a string (e.g., '5') and converts it to an integer.

This gives us the size of the triangle — how many rows to print.

🔸 range(1, int(input())+1)
The range function generates numbers from 1 up to N (inclusive).

i takes values 1, 2, 3, ..., N — each represents a row in the triangle.

🧠 Palindromic Pattern Insight
Let’s look at what should be printed for each row i:

i	Printed Value
1	1
2	121
3	12321
4	1234321
5	123454321

These are numeric palindromes (they read the same forward and backward), and they follow a known mathematical pattern.

🧮 Math Trick: ((10**i)//9)**2
Let’s break this down:

🔹 10**i
This is 10 raised to the power i.

For i = 1, 10**1 = 10

For i = 2, 10**2 = 100

For i = 3, 10**3 = 1000

And so on…

🔹 10**i // 9
Dividing 10**i by 9 gives us a number made entirely of 1s:

10 // 9 = 1

100 // 9 = 11

1000 // 9 = 111

10000 // 9 = 1111

This happens because:

10
𝑖
−
1
9
=
a number with 
𝑖
 ones
9
10 
i
 −1
​
 =a number with i ones
So:

10
1
9
=
1
9
10 
1
 
​
 =1

10
2
9
=
11
9
10 
2
 
​
 =11

10
3
9
=
111
9
10 
3
 
​
 =111

And so on...

🔹 Squaring That: (...)**2
Squaring those "1-pattern" numbers gives the palindromes:

1
2
=
1
1 
2
 =1

11
2
=
121
11 
2
 =121

111
2
=
12321
111 
2
 =12321

1111
2
=
1234321
1111 
2
 =1234321

This is a well-known math identity:

(
111...1
)
2
=
palindromic number
(111...1) 
2
 =palindromic number
