Let's break this down and solve the task step-by-step, explaining the Python logic at each stage.

ðŸ”§ Python Core Concepts Involved:

set is a built-in Python data structure for storing unique elements.

update(), intersection_update(), difference_update(), and symmetric_difference_update() are methods that mutate the original set.

input(), split(), and map() are used for reading and processing input from the user.

âœ… Task Summary:

You're given:

An initial set A

N operations, each with:

An operation name (e.g., update)

A set of elements to apply the operation with

The goal is to mutate A using all operations and print sum(A) at the end.

ðŸ“˜ Here's the complete solution in Python:

python
Copy
Edit
# Step 1: Read the number of elements in set A
n = int(input())

# Step 2: Read the elements of set A
A = set(map(int, input().split()))

# Step 3: Read number of operations
N = int(input())

# Step 4: Loop over each operation
for _ in range(N):
    # Read the operation and number of elements (we can ignore the number)
    op_name, _ = input().split()
    # Read the elements for the other set
    other_set = set(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Use getattr to dynamically call the appropriate method on A
    getattr(A, op_name)(other_set)

# Step 5: Output the sum of the elements in the final set
print(sum(A))
ðŸ§  How it works:

map(int, input().split()) turns input strings into integers.

set(...) wraps them into a Python set.

getattr(A, op_name) fetches the set method dynamically.

sum(A) computes the final sum of all elements after mutation.

ðŸ“Œ Example: With your sample input, the final set becomes {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 13, 14}, and the sum is:

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 13 + 14 = 92
â†’ After all operations, only a subset remains
â†’ Final sum = 38 âœ…
