✅ Line 1:
python
Copy
Edit
n_english = int(input())
What it does: Reads the number of students who have subscribed to the English newspaper.

Core concept:

input() → takes user input as a string.

int() → converts that string to an integer.

✅ Line 2:
python
Copy
Edit
english_subscribers = set(map(int, input().split()))
What it does:

Reads roll numbers (space-separated), converts them into integers, and stores them in a set.

Core concepts:

input().split() → splits the input string into a list of strings (tokens).

map(int, ...) → converts each token into an integer.

set(...) → stores the integers in a set, which automatically removes duplicates and allows for set operations like union and intersection.

✅ Line 4–5:
python
Copy
Edit
n_french = int(input())
french_subscribers = set(map(int, input().split()))
Same logic as above, but for French newspaper subscribers.

✅ Line 8:
python
Copy
Edit
total_unique_subscribers = english_subscribers.union(french_subscribers)
What it does: Combines both sets and removes any duplicates, giving you students who subscribed to at least one newspaper.

Core concept:

.union() → is a set method that returns a new set containing all unique elements from both sets.

Alternative syntax: english_subscribers | french_subscribers (same result using the | operator).

✅ Line 11:
python
Copy
Edit
print(len(total_unique_subscribers))
What it does: Prints the total count of unique students.

Core concepts:

len() → built-in function to get the number of elements in a set.

print() → displays the result to the user.

🔁 Summary of Logic:
Take roll numbers from input.

Store them in sets to automatically handle uniqueness.

Use union() to get students who subscribed to either English or French.

Use len() to count them.

✅ Why sets?
Fast membership checking (in operator).

Automatically handles duplicates.

Powerful set operations: union, intersection, difference, etc.
