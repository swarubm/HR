âœ… 1. Reading the number of English newspaper subscribers
python
Copy
Edit
english_count = int(input())
input() reads input from the user as a string.

int() converts that string into an integer.

This line captures how many students have subscribed to the English newspaper.

This value isn't used later, but it's read to maintain the expected input format.

âœ… 2. Reading and storing English subscriber roll numbers in a set
python
Copy
Edit
english_subs = set(map(int, input().split()))
input().split() reads a line of space-separated values and splits them into a list of strings.

Example: "1 2 3" â†’ ["1", "2", "3"]

map(int, ...) applies int() to each string, converting the list to integers.

["1", "2", "3"] â†’ [1, 2, 3]

set(...) converts the list of integers to a set, removing duplicates and allowing set operations.

Example: [1, 2, 2, 3] â†’ {1, 2, 3}

âœ… 3. Reading the number of French newspaper subscribers
python
Copy
Edit
french_count = int(input())
Again, this reads the count of French newspaper subscribers using the same logic as step 1.

Not used directly, but read to match the input format.

âœ… 4. Reading and storing French subscriber roll numbers in a set
python
Copy
Edit
french_subs = set(map(int, input().split()))
Same process as step 2, but for French subscribers.

Result is a set of roll numbers for students subscribed to the French newspaper.

âœ… 5. Finding students who subscribed only to the English newspaper
python
Copy
Edit
only_english = english_subs.difference(french_subs)
.difference() is a method of Pythonâ€™s set type.

It returns a new set with all elements from english_subs that are not in french_subs.

This is a key use of set theory in Python: subtracting one set from another.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
english_subs = {1, 2, 3, 4}
french_subs = {2, 3}
only_english = english_subs.difference(french_subs)  # â†’ {1, 4}
âœ… 6. Printing the result
python
Copy
Edit
print(len(only_english))
len() gives the number of elements in the only_english set.

print() outputs that number â€” which is your final answer.

ðŸ§  Core Concepts You Used
Concept	Used In
input()	Reading data from the user
int()	Type conversion for numeric input
map()	Applying a function (here int) to a sequence
split()	Turning a string into a list of values
set()	Storing unique values and using set operations
.difference()	Subtracting one set from another
len()	Measuring the size of a container
print()	Outputting the result

ðŸ§© How to Approach Similar Problems
Break input into parts â€” Read and store using the right data structures.

Think about what operation is needed â€” Union? Intersection? Difference?

Use Pythonâ€™s built-in tools â€” Sets are powerful for these use cases.

Always test with examples â€” Confirm your logic with sample data.
