We are given:

An integer K â€“ the number of members in each family group.

A list of room numbers, where:

Every room number except one (the Captainâ€™s room) appears exactly K times.

One room number (the Captainâ€™s) appears only once.

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Find and print the Captain's room number.

âœ… Step-by-Step Code Explanation
python
Copy
Edit
# Step 1: Read group size
K = int(input())
ðŸ§  Python concept used:

input() reads a line of input as a string.

int(...) converts it into an integer.

ðŸ“Œ In this problem, K tells us how many times each groupâ€™s room number appears in the list. The Captainâ€™s room number is the only one that appears once.

python
Copy
Edit
# Step 2: Read the list of room numbers
rooms = list(map(int, input().split()))
ðŸ§  Python concepts used:

input().split() breaks a string of space-separated values into a list of strings.

map(int, ...) converts each string to an integer.

list(...) collects those integers into a Python list.

ðŸ“Œ rooms now holds all room numbers, including duplicates.

ðŸ§ª Example:

makefile

Input: 1 2 3 2 1 3 2 3 1 3 2 1 8
Output: rooms = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 8]
python
Copy

# Step 3: Use the formula
captain_room = (K * sum(set(rooms)) - sum(rooms)) // (K - 1)
ðŸ§  Math + Python concepts used:

set(rooms) gives the unique room numbers (removes duplicates).

sum(...) calculates the total of elements in a list or set.

Integer arithmetic is used to apply a mathematical formula.

ðŸ’¡ Key logic:

Let:

S = sum(set(rooms)) = sum of all unique room numbers

T = sum(rooms) = total sum of all room numbers (with duplicates)

Now imagine each unique room appears K times, except the Captainâ€™s room (letâ€™s call it x), which appears only once.

That means:

ini
Copy
Edit
T = K * (S - x) + x
Solving that:

ini
Copy
Edit
x = (K * S - T) / (K - 1)
We use integer division // because room numbers are whole numbers.

python
Copy
Edit
# Step 4: Print the captain's room number
print(captain_room)
ðŸ§  Python concept:

Simple print() function to output the result.

ðŸ“Œ This will print the Captainâ€™s room number, the one that appears only once.

ðŸ§  How This Helps You in Similar Problems
This approach teaches you to:

Use sets to eliminate duplicates.

Apply count-based logic with math when a pattern of repetition is known.

Use input parsing with map() and split() for processing bulk input.

Apply clever mathematical deductions instead of brute-force methods (e.g., no need for loops or counters).

ðŸ§ª Optional Alternate Approach (for learning)
You could also solve this using collections.Counter, which gives the count of each item:

python
Copy
Edit
from collections import Counter

K = int(input())
rooms = list(map(int, input().split()))
room_counts = Counter(rooms)

for room, count in room_counts.items():
    if count == 1:
        print(room)
        break
